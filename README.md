# Google_Trends_and_Data_Visualisation

## Description
I had information from different bases. In this code, I tried to compare the data and discover possible patterns affecting the ups and downs. For this purpose, I have used pandas and Matplotlib in this code.
In this code, I have used the following points.
.describe(): to view the summary of descriptive statistics parameters of the data frame.
.resample(): changing the periodicity of time series data.
matplotlib.dates Locators: to specify the time-axis coordinates
isna() ,values.sum(): find NaN values

###Target
Google Trends gives us an estimate of search volume. Let's explore if search popularity relates to other kinds of data. Perhaps there are patterns in Google's search volume and the price of Bitcoin or a hot stock like Tesla. Perhaps search volume for the term "Unemployment Benefits" can tell us something about the actual unemployment rate?
Data Sources:
Unemployment Rate from FRED
Google Trends
Yahoo Finance for Tesla Stock Price
Yahoo Finance for Bitcoin Stock Price
